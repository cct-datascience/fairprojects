# FAIR projects dashboard
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/pages-dashboard-steelblue?link=https://fair.odissei-soda.nl&logo=GitHub)

ðŸª¶ A lightweight dashboard to track the [FAIRness](https://fair-software.eu) of an organization's projects on GitHub

# Installation

We tried to make the setup as simple as possible:

1. Fork the repo.
2. [Create a personal access token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) and add it to the repository's secrets with the name `DASHBOARD_PAT`. The token only needs access to public repositories.
3. Edit the configuration in [config.toml](./config.toml).
4. Set up GitHub pages.
5. Activate the github action.
