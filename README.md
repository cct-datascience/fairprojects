[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/pages-dashboard-steelblue?link=https://fair.odissei-soda.nl&logo=GitHub)](https://fair.odissei-soda.nl)

ðŸª¶ A lightweight dashboard to track the [FAIRness](https://fair-software.eu) of an organization's projects on GitHub

## Installation

We tried to make the setup as simple as possible:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Edit the configuration in [config.toml](./config.toml).
4. Set up GitHub pages to deploy from GitHub Actions.
5. Activate the GitHub action.
