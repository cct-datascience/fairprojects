# fairprojects dashboard

A lightweight dashboard to track the FAIRness of an organization's projects on github.

FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable -- see https://fair-software.eu.

# Setup

We tried to make the setup as simple as possible:

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a personal access token (PAT) and add it to the repository's secrets with the name `DASHBOARD_PAT`
3. Edit the configuration in [config.toml](./config.toml)
4. Set up GitHub pages 
5. Activate the github action
