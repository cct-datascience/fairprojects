# fairprojects dashboard

A lightweight dashboard to track the FAIRness of your organization's projects on github.

FAIR: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable -- see https://fair-software.eu.

# Setup

We tried to make the setup as simple as possible:

1. Fork the repo
2. Edit the configuration in [config.toml](./config.toml)
3. Set up GitHub pages 
4. Activate the github action
